### Prerequisites
You should have basic understanding of front end application architectures. Not must but if you know Flux,Redux or MobX that will help to evalute to PureData. Knowledge of typescript will also help in understanding and developing PureData applications.

## Thoughts
An experience front end architect will create the architecture with following expectaions
* Predictability
* Maintainability
* Flexibility
* Adaptibility
* Stability

One thing to note here is these are expectations from your application architecture not from framework your are using(e.g. AngularJS, ReactJS, VueJS etc). Your should use tools/libraries to achieve these expectations.

### Indroduction
PureData helps you to keep your data seperate from your application logic in order to keep it Pure.
### Installing
```
npm install --save pure-data
```
